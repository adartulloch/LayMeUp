This is a simple script that will offer you randomized, low-odds parlays given a certain confidence interval. Say, one night, you want a bet no riskier than +105 with confidence >= 90% given historical data. As long as such events exist (in USA only), this script will offer random legs. 

Customizable to the core! Input your own odds, confidence margin, leg-amount, and let it handle the rest. 

Chase that bread!
